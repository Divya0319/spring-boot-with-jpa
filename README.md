# Spring Boot with JPA
A Demo Spring boot app built using Java Persistence Library (JPA), for performing CRUD operations from local database.

It performs CRUD operations based on endpoints, and using HTTP methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The application has no frontend portion, just the backend, returning data in the form of JSON, or if some error occurs, it throws the exception.
